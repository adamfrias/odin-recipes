      <li>Unsalted Butter</li>
      <li>Extra Virgin Olive Oil</li>
      <li>Garlic</li>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Heat olive oil and 2 tablespoons of butter in a large pan or skillet.
        Add garlic and sauté until fragrant (about 30 seconds - 1 minute). Then
        add the shrimp, season with salt and pepper to taste and sauté for 1-2
        minutes on one side (until just beginning to turn pink), then flip.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour in wine (or broth), add red pepper flakes (if using). Bring to a
        simmer for 1-2 minutes or until wine reduces by about half and the
        shrimp is cooked through (don't over cook your shrimp).
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir in the remaining butter, lemon juice and parsley and take off heat
        immediately.
      </li>
      <li>
        Serve over rice, pasta, garlic bread or steamed vegetables (cauliflower,
        broccoli, zucchini noodles).
